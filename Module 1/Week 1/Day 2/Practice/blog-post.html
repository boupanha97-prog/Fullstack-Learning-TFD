                <p>Semantic HTML is the practice of using HTML markup to reinforce the meaning of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. By using elements like &lt;article&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;, we give context to our content, which has numerous benefits.</p>
                <p>One of the primary advantages is for accessibility. Screen readers and other assistive technologies rely on a well-structured, semantic DOM to interpret the page for users. A &lt;nav&gt; element is explicitly announced as navigation, allowing users to easily find their way around the site.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, it significantly improves SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Search engine crawlers can better understand the content and structure of your site, which can lead to better rankings. An &lt;h1&gt; tag carries more weight than a generic &lt;div&gt; styled to look like a heading, signaling to the crawler that this is the main topic of the page.</p>
